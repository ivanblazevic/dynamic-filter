# Dynamic Filter

Dynamic filter generates JSON key-array object as result of user selection. This is generic library which can be implemented in any JS framework.
Checkout examples for major JS frameworks bellow:

### AngularJS EXAMPLE: [Dynamic Filter with AngularJS](https://ivanblazevic.github.io/angular-dynamic-filter/)
### Angular4 EXAMPLE: [Dynamic Filter with Angular4](https://ivanblazevic.github.io/angular-dynamic-filter/)
### ReactJS EXAMPLE: [Dynamic Filter with ReactJS](https://ivanblazevic.github.io/angular-dynamic-filter/)

# Features!

  - Ability to add custom design with custom directive templates
  - Full flexibility based on options configuration
  - Save filter state using browser's local storage
  - Fully created with TypeScript
  - Auto/manual mode for applying filter

# Input Types

  - OPTIONS - Predefined string array to use in select dropdown
  - TEXT - just a regular text input
  - AUTOCOMPLETE - typeahead, pass function for querying backend/frontend. Check  example Autocomplete](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/autocomplete)

You can also:
  - pass errorCallback function if you want to receive errors from filter and handle in controller

# API

### CONFIG

- **id** - string - used when saving data to local storage, set different id if there are multiple filters per page to avoid interference - if not set it defaults to "dynamicFilter"
- **saveState** - boolean - save filter state to localStorage, filter will be in same state after page reload
- **autoApply** - boolean - execute callback on each filter change
- **callback** - function - callback to execute on autoApply or manual, as result returns key-array object
- **errorCallback** - function - receive filter error data as callback, ie. to handle error messages from controller

### OPTION

NOTE: This is example of one option object. DynamicFilter accepts array of this objects for initialization.
Let's see a basic example:

- **type** - enum - OPTIONS/TEXT/AUTOCOMPLETE *(Check input types details)*
- **label** - string - custom label text will be displayed in main option selection
- **field** - string - this will be key of object which is generated as a result *Usually this is table field from backend*
- **options** - string array for selection

Examples for all types:

#### OPTIONS
```
type: "OPTIONS",
label: "Material",
field: "material",
options: $scope.dataSource.map(function(m) { return m.name })
```
#### AUTOCOMPLETE
```
type: "AUTOCOMPLETE",
label: "Material",
field: "material",
params: {
     querySearch: $scope.querySearch
}
```
#### TEXT
```
type: "TEXT",
label: "Material",
field: "material"
```
